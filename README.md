ApprovalTests.Python
====================

Capturing Human Intelligence - ApprovalTests is an open source assertion/verification library to aid testing.  `approvaltests` is the ApprovalTests port for Python.

For more information see: [www.approvaltests.com](http://approvaltests.com/).

##What can I use ApprovalTests for?

You can use ApprovalTests to verify objects that require more than a simple assert including long strings, large arrays, and complex hash structures and objects.  ApprovalTests really shines when you need a more granular look at the test failure.  Sometimes, trying to find a small difference in a long string printed to STDOUT is just too hard!  ApprovalTests solves this problem by providing reporters which let you view the test results in one of many popular diff utilities.

##SETUP

From pypi:

	pip install approvaltests
